# Machine Learning Internship Project   Codsoft

Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship project showcase! Throughout this internship, I had the opportunity to work on three exciting projects, each highlighting different aspects of machine learning. Let's explore the implementations of Customer Churn Prediction, SMS Spam Detection, and Movie Genre Classification.

## 1. Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting customer churn using a Random Forest Classifier. By leveraging this powerful algorithm, the model analyzes customer data to identify potential churn scenarios. The emphasis was on creating a robust and accurate predictive model, with features such as dataset preprocessing, cleaning, and advanced evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error.



## 2. SMS Spam Detection

The SMS Spam Detection project focuses on building a classifier to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model processes and analyzes text data to identify patterns indicative of spam. This implementation showcases the application of machine learning in solving real-world communication challenges.



## 3. Movie Genre Classification

Diving into the realm of entertainment, the Movie Genre Classification project demonstrates the application of machine learning in predicting movie genres based on plot summaries. Through the use of text-based matching and Randomforest Classifier, the model provides personalized movie suggestions. This implementation showcases the versatility of machine learning in the creative domain.
